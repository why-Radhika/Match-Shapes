# Match-Shapes
Simple, basic memory game using pygame.

Welcome to my first Pygame project - a memory game using shapes! This project is a simple yet engaging game where players need to match pairs of shapes hidden within a 4x4 matrix. It's a great way to exercise your memory and have fun at the same time.
